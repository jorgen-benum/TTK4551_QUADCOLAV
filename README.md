# Quadrotor collision avoidance and high speed navigation using model predictive control

This repo contains the final code of the Specialization Project: 
- where a model predictive control formulation for a quadrotor is develop and tested, for
the purpose of collision avoidance and high speed navigation in unknown environment where
the robotâ€™s surroundings are represented by depth data from an onboard 3D-LiDAR.
- The framework for testing and simulation is also in this repo
